            <p>CSE Scholars is one of the premier CS student organizations at the University of Michigan. We've provided our members with great social, service, and networking opportunities to better themselves. Corporate partnership is a large part of providing these events to our members, free of charge. We've successfully worked with some of the largest Fortune 500 software companies, as well as some of the smallest bootstrapped startups.</p>

            <p>We hold a wide variety of events with companies. We've hosted information sessions, workshops, general meetings, social events, resume reviews, and more. These events are designed to be both useful for our members, as well as fantastic recruiting solutions for the companies.</p>
